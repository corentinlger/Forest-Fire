# Forest-Fire


This is a Python-based forest fire simulation using cellular automaton. In this simulation, firefighters with scripted behavior attempt to contain and extinguish the spreading fires.

- Here is an example of simulation:

## Things to improve 

- **Firefighter Behavior:** Explore methods to improve the behavior of firefighters. This could involve refining their strategies or even training them using machine learning techniques.

- **Simulation Dynamics:** Enhance the realism of the simulation by refining how trees grow, determining fire ignition points, and optimizing fire spread patterns.
